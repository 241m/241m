*Hello, there!*

I'm zaim, a.k.a 241m (1337 speak), a.k.a zzzaim (my old username, see below).
I'm a solo coder/designer. My location is in GMT+8 but I live like it's GMT-4.

*I'm a something of a coder myself*

Studied Software Engineering (graduated 2002). Was in the IT workforce in
various positions for over 10 years. Started doing freelancing and solo
development circa 2012. I consider myself a full stack developer.

*What's in a name?*

Every 3-5 years I reset my online identity (register new email, close down
unused accounts, create new primaries). My previous GitHub profile -
[zzzaim](https://github.com/zzzaim) - is still up for archival purposes.
